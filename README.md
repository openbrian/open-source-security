Abstract: What's the best way to secure your open source dependencies? Not have any. But since over 80% of the source code that's shipped is derived from open source that's just not a reality. This makes auditing and managing your dependencies critical to achieving security compliance and instilling confidence in your application.

This talk will cover secure dependency management from both a proactive and reactive standpoint. We'll go over monitoring and auditing best practices, take a tour of available tools and walk through how to automate the detection of insecure patterns and outdated libraries affected by known vulnerabilities.
